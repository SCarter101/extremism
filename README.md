# extremism

Interrogate common traits of individual vulnerability, exposure, motivation, and action, grounded in multi-layer theories (sociologic, psychologic, neurologic), to pinpoint contributing causal factors for a person engaging with extreme beliefs to escalate to violence. Establish a computational model (i.e., multi-model learning model, game-theoretic model, or threshold model) to classify trigger points within a social system that agitates to the point of violent action and where potential points of intervention may exist.
